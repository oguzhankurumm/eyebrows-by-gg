# Portfolio Content Guidelines

To maintain a high-quality and consistent portfolio on the website, please adhere to the following guidelines when preparing new images.

## 1. Aspect Ratio & Dimensions
- **Aspect Ratio:** **3:4 (Portrait)** is the standard ratio for the portfolio grid.
  - *Why?* This ratio works best for face and eyebrow close-ups and ensures the masonry layout remains visually consistent.
- **Resolution:**
  - Minimum: **1200 x 1600 pixels**
  - Recommended: **1500 x 2000 pixels** or higher
  - Avoid upscaling low-resolution images.

## 2. File Format & Size
- **Format:** **WebP** (preferred) or **JPG/JPEG**.
- **Quality:** Save at 80-90% quality to balance visual fidelity and file size.
- **File Size:** Aim for under **300KB** per image if possible, to ensure fast loading times.

## 3. Visual Style
- **Lighting:** Use consistent, bright, and soft lighting. Avoid harsh shadows on the brows.
- **Cropping:**
  - Center the face/brows.
  - Leave some breathing room around the subject (don't crop too tight).
  - Ensure the eyes and brows are in sharp focus.
- **Consistency:** Try to maintain a similar zoom level across before/after photos.

## 4. Metadata (for Developers/Content Managers)
When adding images to `data/gallery-items.ts`:
- **Category:** Assign a clear category (e.g., "Ombre Powder", "Nano Brows", "Combo Brows").
- **Alt Text:** Provide a descriptive alt text for accessibility (e.g., "Healed Ombre Powder Brows on fair skin").
